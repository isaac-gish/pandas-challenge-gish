# pandas-challenge-gish
Repository Challenge 4


All code for this assignment is found inside the PyCitySchools folder, inside the PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb file.

All code using pd.merge should be credited to Shannon Lloyd. Shannon Lloyd coached me on how to use merges by showing me her code. My written code was inspired by the code she showed to me. 

All other code was authored by myself. 

Some lines do not have output because it was created to be in the School Summary dataframe, not to view the output from the cell.
